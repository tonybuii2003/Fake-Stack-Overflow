TODO:
Include a script called server/init.js in your repository that will be run to create initial data in your schema. 
This script will be run using Node before starting the server. 

The initial data must contain the user profile for admin, so the username and password for an admin user 
must be provided as the first argument to server/init.js. 
You must use these credentials to create a user profile for admin in the database.
